✔ Project Overview: This repository features a robust data analysis project focused on deriving actionable business intelligence from real-world food delivery sales data. The core deliverable is a dynamic, interactive dashboard that successfully transforms over ₹53.01M in sales transactions into a clear, single source of truth for executive decision-making.

The project demonstrates proficiency in translating a Business Requirements Document (BRD) into a high-impact analytical solution, covering critical dimensions such as customer satisfaction, geographic performance, and temporal sales trends.

✔ Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
   ➡ Total Sales: ₹53.01M (Overall revenue generated from all food orders)
   ➡ Average Rating:	4.34 (Consolidated customer satisfaction level across all restaurants)
   ➡ Total Orders:	197.43K	(Total volume of food orders received)
   ➡ Avg Order Value (₹):	₹268.51	(Revenue generated per order, key to profitability analysis)
   ➡ Rating Count:	5.59M	(Total customer reviews, indicating engagement and data depth)

High-Impact Insights:Non-Veg Dominance: Confirmed that Non-Veg sales account for 66% of total revenue, guiding primary marketing and inventory strategies.
Geographical Hotspot: Identified Bengaluru as the top revenue-contributing city ₹}5.46M, validating regional investment focus.

✔ Project Execution (The STAR Method): 
   ➡ Business Challenge Defined / Situation: The business lacked a centralized, unified analytical tool to effectively track granular sales performance and customer feedback across multiple variables (time, product, and geography). This hindered proactive strategic planning.
   ➡ Solution Objective / Task: Design and implement an interactive Sales Dashboard, compliant with a detailed BRD, to track 5 core business KPIs and visualize 7 critical sales trends (e.g., Monthly, Daily, Quarterly) for comprehensive operational oversight.
   ➡ Project Implementation / Action: Developed the end-to-end data model and ETL process. Created the dynamic dashboard using visualization tools (Excel/Power BI), incorporating slicers for Month/Category filtering, and ensuring the accurate presentation of trends, including the Sales by State Map and Top 5 Cities by Sales.
   ➡ Measurable Business Outcomes / Result: Successfully created a single source of truth that provided immediate, actionable insights. This led to a clear understanding of peak operational periods (e.g., Saturday sales peak), key revenue drivers, and areas requiring strategic focus, ultimately enabling optimal resource allocation and improved business forecasting.

✔ Technology Stack:
   ➡ Core Tools: Microsoft Excel (for data manipulation and visualization)
   ➡ Skills: Data Modeling, Business Requirements Analysis (BRD), KPI Development, Data Visualization, and Interactive Dashboard Design.
   
✔ Conclusion & Value Delivered: This project successfully delivered a robust and flexible analytics platform that provides leadership with the tools to monitor performance in real-time and make data-backed strategic decisions. By centralizing ₹53.01M in sales data, the dashboard moves the organization from reactive reporting to proactive forecasting and optimized resource deployment across all sales territories.
